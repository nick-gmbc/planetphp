        <div class="container" style="margin-left: 0px">
            <div class="row" style="margin-left: -20px">
                <div class="col-sm-4">
                    <h2 style="margin-left: 0px">What is PHP?</h2>
                    <p>PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used, open-source server-side 
                    scripting language designed for web development. Created by Rasmus Lerdorf 
                    in 1994, PHP allows developers to build dynamic and interactive websites by 
                    embedding scripts directly within HTML.</p>

                    <p>When a PHP script runs, it is processed on the server, and the resulting 
                    output—usually HTML—is sent to the user's web browser. This server-side 
                    execution makes PHP ideal for tasks like handling forms, managing sessions, 
                    interacting with databases, and creating customized page content based on user 
                    input.</p>

                    <p>One of PHP's main strengths is its simplicity and ease of use, even for beginners. 
                    At the same time, it offers advanced features for experienced developers, 
                    including support for object-oriented programming and integration with a wide
                     range of databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.</p>

                    <p>PHP is the backbone of many popular content management systems, including 
                        WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. It also powers a large portion of the web, thanks 
                        to its compatibility with most hosting services and its ability to run on 
                        multiple platforms.</p>

                    <p>With ongoing updates and modern frameworks like Laravel and Symfony, PHP 
                        continues to be a reliable and powerful tool for building fast, scalable web 
                        applications.</p>

                    <h2>Capabilities of PHP</h2>
                        <p>PHP provides strong support for session management, which is essential 
                            for developing login systems, shopping carts, and other user-interactive 
                            applications. It includes built-in functions for file handling, allowing 
                            reading, writing, and uploading files via web forms. Error handling is 
                            flexible and customizable, with options for logging and displaying errors.</p>

                        <p>
                            PHP also supports object-oriented programming (OOP), enabling modular, 
                            reusable, and scalable code structures. It offers extensive libraries and 
                            frameworks like Laravel, Symfony, and CodeIgniter, which simplify and speed 
                            up development processes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Security features such as input validation, data sanitization, 
                            and tools to prevent SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) 
                            are readily available. Additionally, PHP supports communication 
                            with other services via APIs, JSON, and XML.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Finally, PHP is highly portable and supported by almost all web servers 
                            and operating systems, making it an ideal choice for a wide range of
                             web-based projects.
                        </p>

                    <h2>Problems of PHP</h2>


                    <p>
                        Security is a concern. Although PHP has improved over time, inexperienced developers can easily 
                        write vulnerable code if proper precautions like input validation and prepared statements 
                        aren’t used. Older PHP codebases often lack modern security practices, making maintenance risky.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Performance can be an issue for larger applications. PHP is interpreted at 
                        runtime, which generally makes it slower than compiled languages. While 
                        tools like OPCache and Just-In-Time compilation help, performance still lags 
                        behind more modern alternatives like Node.js or Go in some cases.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        PHP’s flexibility can also lead to poor coding practices. It allows multiple ways to 
                        achieve the same result, which can lead to inconsistent code and difficulties in maintaining large 
                        projects. Additionally, legacy code and outdated tutorials can mislead newcomers, making it
                         harder to adopt best practices from the beginning.
                    </p>
